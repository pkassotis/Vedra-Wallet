## Vedra Coin (VXYZ)

Scrypt-based implementation of Vedra.

Because of the high volume of files you’ll find everything you need (including the entire source code) inside the “Vedra Multi-OS Wallets” file. Feel free to use Vedra and experiment with it however you like. The goal is to bring a universal microtransaction currency to life so the more game developers adopt it the better it’s going to get.

Use the following instructions to mine a block on macOS.

Open your wallet, and make sure your wallet is connected with a node.
Your wallet is connected when you see the icon Wallet connections scrypt and SHA256 in the lower right corner of your wallet.

The message “Syncing Headers (0,0%)” will disappear once you mine your first block.

Note: replace “examplecoin” with the name of your coin.

Close your wallet and create the file examplecoin.conf in the folder “$HOME/Library/Application Support/Examplecoin/”.

Paste the following text into examplecoin.conf and save the file.
rpcuser=rpc_examplecoin
rpcpassword=pifw1fqxfkdd23n59rcr63sqrfiqkw184uxb0blo
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
listen=1
server=1
addnode=node1.walletbuilders.com

Open your wallet.

Create a .sh file named mine.sh in the same folder where you extracted example-cli with the following content.
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPT_PATH=`pwd`;
cd $SCRIPT_PATH
echo Press [CTRL+C] to stop mining.
while :
do
./examplecoin-cli generate 1
done

Save the file mine.sh.

Click the Finder icon in your dock.
Click Go.
Click Utilities.
Double-click Terminal.

Go to the directory where you extracted examplecoin-qt.
E.G. cd Downloads

Execute the following command in Terminal to make mine.sh executable.
chmod +x mine.sh

Execute the following command in Terminal to start mining your first block.
./mine.sh

It will take about +/- 30 minutes to mine your first block, depending on your computer hardware.

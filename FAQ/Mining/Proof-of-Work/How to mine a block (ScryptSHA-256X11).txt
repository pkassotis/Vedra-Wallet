Use the following instructions to mine a block.

Open your wallet, and make sure your wallet is connected with a node.
Your wallet is connected when you see the icon :S. in the lower right corner of your wallet.

The message “Syncing Headers (0,0%)” will disappear once you mine your first block.

Note: replace “examplecoin” with the name of your coin.

Close your wallet and create the file examplecoin.conf in the folder “%APPDATA%\examplecoin”.

Paste the following text into examplecoin.conf and save the file.
rpcuser=rpc_examplecoin
rpcpassword=pifw1fqxfkdd23n59rcr63sqrfiqkw184uxb0blo
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
listen=1
server=1
addnode=node1.walletbuilders.com

Open your wallet.

Create a .bat file named mine.bat in the same folder where you extracted example-cli.exe and paste the following text into mine.bat.
@echo off
set path_cli=%cd%
cd %path_cli%
echo Press [CTRL+C] to stop mining.
:begin
 examplecoin-cli.exe generate 1
goto begin

Save the file.

Execute mine.bat to start mining your first block.

It will take about +/- 30 minutes to mine your first block, depending on your computer hardware.

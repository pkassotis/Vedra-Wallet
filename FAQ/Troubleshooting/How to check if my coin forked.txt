You can check if your wallets are on the same fork by comparing the hash of a block.

You can show the current block height of your wallet using the command "getblockcount".
This will output a number.

E.G. 1337

Use the command "getblockhash" to show the hash of a block.

Compare the output of both wallets and make sure that the hash is the same.

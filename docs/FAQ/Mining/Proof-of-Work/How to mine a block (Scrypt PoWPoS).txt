Use the following instructions to mine a block.

Open your wallet, and make sure your wallet is connected with a node.
Your wallet is connected when you see the icon Wallet connections in the left corner of your wallet.

The message “Synchronizing with network...” will disappear once you mine your first block.

Note: replace “examplecoin” with the name of your coin.

Close your wallet and create the file examplecoin.conf in the folder “%APPDATA%\examplecoin\”.

Paste the following text into examplecoin.conf and save the file.
rpcuser=rpc_user
rpcpassword=8cde5e64e7297b1cb4c495d1a
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=4210
listen=1
server=1
addnode=node1.walletbuilders.com

Open your wallet.

Download cpuminer from here and extract the zip file.

Create a .bat file named mine.bat in the same folder where you extracted cpuminer and paste the following text into mine.bat.
minerd --url=http://127.0.0.1:4210 --userpass=rpc_user:8cde5e64e7297b1cb4c495d1a

Save the file.

Execute mine.bat to start mining your first block.

It will take about +/- 30 minutes to mine your first block, depending on your computer hardware.
